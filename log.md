**Today's Progress**: Perform a successful API call using $.getJSON.

**Thoughts**: Googled around, muttled around with the API's specifics and was finally able to log some of the values to the console. Woot. Still need lots of practice with this but pleased with today.

### Day 1: January 4th, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Attempted to dispaly JSON data in the UI.

**Thoughts**: More difficult than anticipated. Not great progress, but better than nothing.
