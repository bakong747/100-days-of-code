# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3rd, 2017
#### A four octothorp, or hashtag denoted line

**Today's Progress**: Perform a successful API call using $.getJSON.

**Thoughts**: Googled around, muttled around with the API's specifics and was finally able to log some of the values to the console. Woot. Still need lots of practice with this but pleased with today.

### Day 2: January 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Attempted to dispaly JSON data in the UI.

### Day 4: January 6th, 2017

### Day 5: January 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Nice breakthrough on using $.getJSON and creating an HTML table (not finished, however)

**Thoughts**: Putting the $.getJSON() method invocation inside an IIFE which is itself inside a for loop is causing a race problem i.e.  each api call is finishing in an undeterministic way (maybe that's fine due to the live, dynamic nature of twitch?).

### Day 6: January 8th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed race issue => wrapped $.getJSON stuff in a $(document).ready(function()) function.

**Thoughts**: Making steady progress, kind of feeling like I'm getting to the heart of this. Hopefully be done in 1-2 more sessions.

### Day 10: January 12th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Reading up on Angular 2 vs. React in prepartion for the next projects.

### Day 11: January 13th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More practice with React.

**Thoughts**: Component names must be capitalized. Otherwise, it will not work as expected. 3 CDN downloads in the HTML file.

**Link(s) to work**: none

### Day 14: January 16th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Attempted to do slightly more complex work i.e. get a display to show all the buttons that get pressed. Stalled on progress.

### Day 15: January 17th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More very helpful React reading on state (https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html). Finally able to get the display component to read the output of the buttons that get pressed. Great success!
