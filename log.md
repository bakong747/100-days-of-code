**Today's Progress**: Perform a successful API call using $.getJSON.

**Thoughts**: Googled around, muttled around with the API's specifics and was finally able to log some of the values to the console. Woot. Still need lots of practice with this but pleased with today.

**Link(s) to work**: [Free Code Camp TwitchTV JSON API Project (CodePen)] (http://codepen.io/bakong7/pen/qqOggm)
