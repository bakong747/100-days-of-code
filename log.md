# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3rd, 2017
#### A four octothorp, or hashtag denoted line

**Today's Progress**: Perform a successful API call using $.getJSON.

**Thoughts**: Googled around, muttled around with the API's specifics and was finally able to log some of the values to the console. Woot. Still need lots of practice with this but pleased with today.

**Today's Progress**: Attempted to dispaly JSON data in the UI.

**Thoughts**: More difficult than anticipated. Not great progress, but better than nothing.

**Today's Progress**: Some headway on formatting retrieved JSON data into HTML.

### Day 5: January 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Nice breakthrough on using $.getJSON and creating an HTML table (not finished, however)

**Thoughts**: Putting the $.getJSON() method invocation inside an IIFE which is itself inside a for loop is causing a race problem i.e.  each api call is finishing in an undeterministic way (maybe that's fine due to the live, dynamic nature of twitch?).

### Day 6: January 8th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed race issue => wrapped $.getJSON stuff in a $(document).ready(function()) function.

**Thoughts**: Making steady progress, kind of feeling like I'm getting to the heart of this. Hopefully be done in 1-2 more sessions.

### Day 8: January 10th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Great progress on building the online and offline users table. Went back and polished up the tribute page and quote machine projects.

### Day 10: January 12th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Reading up on Angular 2 vs. React in prepartion for the next projects.

**Thoughts**: Will try to learn as much React in the next 3 days to be able to start building the rest of the projects in the front-end developer section using React.

### Day 11: January 13th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More practice with React.

**Thoughts**: Component names must be capitalized. Otherwise, it will not work as expected. 3 CDN downloads in the HTML file.

**Link(s) to work**: none

### Day 11: January 14th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More practice with React. Starting the Javascript Calculator project on Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts**: Still want to learn more React and Flux architecture and possibly Redux.
