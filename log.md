# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3rd, 2016
#### A four octothorp, or hashtag denoted line

**Today's Progress**: Perform a successful API call using $.getJSON.

**Thoughts**: Googled around, muttled around with the API's specifics and was finally able to log some of the values to the console. Woot. Still need lots of practice with this but pleased with today.

### Day 2: January 4th, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Attempted to dispaly JSON data in the UI.

**Thoughts**: More difficult than anticipated. Not great progress, but better than nothing.

### Day 3: January 5th, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Some headway on formatting retrieved JSON data into HTML.

**Thoughts**: Slowly but surely, progress is being made and the correct data will be displayed in the correct spots.

### Day 4: January 6th, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Continue work on formatting JSON data into HTML table.

**Thoughts**: Not as productive as I would have liked.

### Day 5: January 7th, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Nice breakthrough on using $.getJSON and creating an HTML table (not finished, however)

**Thoughts**: Putting the $.getJSON() method invocation inside an IIFE which is itself inside a for loop is causing a race problem i.e.  each api call is finishing in an undeterministic way (maybe that's fine due to the live, dynamic nature of twitch?).

### Day 6: January 8th, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Fixed race issue => wrapped $.getJSON stuff in a $(document).ready(function()) function.

**Thoughts**: Making steady progress, kind of feeling like I'm getting to the heart of this. Hopefully be done in 1-2 more sessions.
