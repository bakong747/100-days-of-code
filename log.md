# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3rd, 2016
#### A four octothorp, or hashtag denoted line

**Today's Progress**: Perform a successful API call using $.getJSON.

**Thoughts**: Googled around, muttled around with the API's specifics and was finally able to log some of the values to the console. Woot. Still need lots of practice with this but pleased with today.
