# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3rd, 2016
#### A four octothorp, or hashtag denoted line

**Today's Progress**: Perform a successful API call using $.getJSON.

**Thoughts**: Googled around, muttled around with the API's specifics and was finally able to log some of the values to the console. Woot. Still need lots of practice with this but pleased with today.

### Day 2: January 4th, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Attempted to dispaly JSON data in the UI.

**Thoughts**: More difficult than anticipated. Not great progress, but better than nothing.

### Day 3: January 5th, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Some headway on formatting retrieved JSON data into HTML.

### Day 4: January 6th, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Continue work on formatting JSON data into HTML table.

**Thoughts**: Not as productive as I would have liked.

### Day 5: January 7th, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Nice breakthrough on using $.getJSON and creating an HTML table (not finished, however)

**Thoughts**: Putting the $.getJSON() method invocation inside an IIFE which is itself inside a for loop is causing a race problem i.e. each one api call in a different, later iteration is somehow finishing before a previous iteration's api call.
